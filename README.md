 # MemoryMap
 
MemoryMap is a mobile application that allows users to document and relive their travel experiences.

Each location entry can be rated based on the userâ€™s feelings or overall satisfaction with the visit.

## Privacy

This app doesn't require any unnecessary permissions and does not require network connection. This ensures that your memories are completely private and visible only to you.
MemoryMap doesn't send any data to any cloud and all of your pictures stay on your device only. The location requirement is used only to load the map on your location and to enable you to add new memories quickly and easily.
